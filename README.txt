This folder can be placed wherever

Right click the .exe -> Create shortcut if you'd like a desktop shortcut

Don't generate too many ASCII art dicks

There are several bugs that lead to crashes I am aware of

Let me know of any bugs you come across

I'm not sure how to fix this. Kinda sucks :/
